                            <p class="text-center"> Web development broadly refers to the tasks associated with
                                developing websites for hosting via intranet or internet.
                                The web development process includes web design, web content development,
                                client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.<br>

                            <p class="text-center">The essential purpose of photography is communication.
                                Few people take pictures solely to please themselves.
                            Most of us take them because we want them seen by others.
                                We wish or are compelled to inform, educate, entertain,
                                reform, or share some experienced with others.</p>

                                 <p class="text-center">Personal computers are initially used for solving mathematical problems and word processing.
                                      In recent years, however, computers have become necessary for every aspect of our daily activities. These activities range from professional applications 
                                     to personal uses such as internet browsing, shopping, socializing and entertainment. 
                                    <br> Computers are designed to be readily accessible for normal individuals. However, for individuals with severe physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
                                     usage of computers is a very challenging task. There have been many research studies on human computer interface (HCI) to improve the interaction between the user and the computer system. Most of these are applicable only to normal individuals. These interfacing methods 
                                     include a touch sensitive screens, speech recognition methods and many others. Despite the success of these techniques, they were not suitable for the physically disabled individuals
                                    <br> This HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) application in Python(3.6) will allow you to control your mouse cursor with your facial movements, works with just your regular webcam. 
                                    Its hands-free, no wearable hardware or sensors needed.

                                    At this point, you are forced to work with the facial movements I chose but I am working on making them configurable.
                                      <br> List of actions include:
                                       <br> Squinting your eyes (squint (v.) - To look with the eyes partly closed, as in bright sunlight)
                                       <br> Winking
                                       <br> Moving your head around (pitch and yaw)
                                       <br>  Opening your mouth (a little bit, yes)
                                    </p>
